### Similar Apps
I have looked at various apps in the AppStore. First of all, there is an App from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that gives travel advices per country, but not standard information per country. In addition, I have looked at different countries Apps (searched with searchterms such as: "country information", "countries", "travel", "travel guide" and so on). There are many Apps that provide information for one country but that does not provide a clear overview for all countries, what is useful for matters described by "main features". There are also Apps that focus on travel, but the focus is not on information but on booking hotels, showing events and recommending experiences or restaurants/caf√©s. Finally there are quiz Apps, but they miss the information part. I have not come across a complete app that provides fast, useful information about each country in the world. That is why it is important that this App is implemented.
